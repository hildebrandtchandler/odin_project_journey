    <!-- the <a> tag stands for "anchor" and is used for links. href
        stands for "html reference" and is used to direct the links. -->
    
    <!-- links that contain "http:// or https://"" are absolute paths and
        lead to another website. -->
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
    
    <!-- links that don't include "http:// or https://" are relative paths,
    and lead to another page within the same website. the "./" is used to show
    the path relative to the location of the current page. -->

    <!-- the <img> tag stands for "image." src stands for "source" and
    tells the browser where to look for the image. alt is a description used
    for screen readers, or in the event the image cannot be loaded.
    The rules of relative and absolute paths work the same for images as
    they do for links. -->
